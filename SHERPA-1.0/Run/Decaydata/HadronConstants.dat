! Frequently used constants for hadron decays
! Any parameter of them that is written in a decay channel file
! will be overwritten only for that specific channel.


Vud = 0.9744            ! CKM matrix element
Vus = 0.2204            ! CKM matrix element
fpi = 0.0924            ! pion decay constant
fK  = 0.113             ! kaon decay constant
