@subsection Z+jets production

This is an example setup for inclusive Z production at hadron colliders.
The inclusive process is calculated at next-to-leading order accuracy matched
to the parton shower using the MC@@NLO prescription detailed in
@mycite{Hoeche2011fd}. The next few higher jet multiplicities, calculated at
next-to-leading order as well, are merged into the inclusive sample using
the MEPS@@NLO method -- an extension of the CKKW method to NLO -- as described
in @mycite{Hoeche2012yf} and @mycite{Gehrmann2012yg}. Finally, even higher
multiplicities, calculated at leading order, are merged on top of that.
A few things to note are detailed below the previous @ref{LHC_WJets} example
and apply also to this example.
