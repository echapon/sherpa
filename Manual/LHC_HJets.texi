@subsection H+jets production in gluon fusion

This is an example setup for inclusive Higgs production through 
gluon fusion at hadron colliders used in @mycite{Hoeche2014lxa}.
The inclusive process is calculated
at next-to-leading order accuracy matched to the parton shower using 
the MC@@NLO prescription detailed in @mycite{Hoeche2011fd}. The next 
few higher jet multiplicities, calculated at next-to-leading order as well, 
are merged into the inclusive sample using the MEPS@@NLO method -- an 
extension of the CKKW method to NLO -- as described in @mycite{Hoeche2012yf} 
and @mycite{Gehrmann2012yg}. Finally, even higher multiplicities, calculated 
at leading order, are merged on top of that. A few things to note are 
detailed below the example.

Things to notice:
@itemize
@item The example can be converted into a simple MENLOPS setup by replacing
@code{2->1-3} with @code{2->1}, or into an MEPS setup with @code{2->0}, to
study the effect of incorporating higher-order matrix elements.
@item Providers of the one-loop matrix elements for the respective
multiplicities are set using @code{Loop_Generator}. For the two simplest
cases Sherpa can provide it internally. Additionally, MCFM is interfaced for
the H+2jet process, cf. @ref{MCFM interface}.
@item To enable the Higgs to decay to a pair of photons, for example, the 
hard decays are invoked.
For details on the hard decay handling and how to enable specific decay modes 
see @ref{Hard decays}.
