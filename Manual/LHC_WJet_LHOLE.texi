This example computes the next-to-leading W+jet-production
cross section at current LHC energies using the Binoth Les Houches interface 
proposal for an external one-loop generator @mycite{Binoth2010xt}.

Things to notice:
@itemize @bullet
@item this setup includes three run cards, separating the three different 
contributions to an NLO calculation: @code{Run_B.dat} contains the Born 
contribution, @code{Run_I.dat} the virtual and integrated subtraction terms, 
and @code{Run_R.dat} the real and real-subtraction terms.
@item the setup including the virtual bit sets @code{LHOLE} as the loop 
generator. It also need to be added to the @ref{ME_SIGNAL_GENERATOR} list. 
For additional information see @ref{External one-loop ME}.
@item The switch @code{SHERPA_LDADD} present in @code{Run_I.dat} has to 
be set to the appropriate library name (and path) of the one-loop generator. 
In the above example, the corresponding library to be loaded would be 
called @code{libOLE.so}.
@item both the factorisation and renormalisation scales are set to the 
transverse mass of the electron-neutrino pair.
@item @code{LHOLE_CMSBOOST} can be set to @code{1} if the OLE requires the phase 
space points to be in the CMS.
