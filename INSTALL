INSTALLING SHERPA 1.0.7
-----------------------

REQUIREMENTS:
 - Linux or Mac OS. The program is developed under SUSE Linux and
   tested under Mac OS.
 - You need the gnu-compiler gcc. The recommended version of gcc is
   gcc 3.3.1. Newer versions should work, though.
   

INSTALLING:
 - Unpack the Sherpa-1.0.7.tar.gz file obtained from www.sherpa-mc.de
   to the folder where you want Sherpa to reside in ( for example to
   ~/MySherpa/ ). When you read this file you will probably have done
   this already.
 - Open a console.
 - Change to the top-level directory of Sherpa. That´s the directory
   where this file lies in. 
 - From there, type "TOOLS/makeinstall"
 - Wait for the compilation to finish. If you encounter a problem with
   the compilation, try "TOOLS/makeinstall -t". If Sherpa still does not
   compile properly, contact the authors at support@sherpa-mc.de for
   help.
