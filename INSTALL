INSTALLING SHERPA 1.0.7
-----------------------

INSTALLING:
 - Unpack the Sherpa-1.0.7.tar.gz file obtained from www.sherpa-mc.de
   to the folder where you want Sherpa to reside in ( for example to
   ~/MySherpa/ ). When you read this file you will probably have done
   this already.
 - Open a console.
 - Change to the top-level directory of Sherpa. That´s the directory
   where this file lies in. 
 - From there, type "TOOLS/makeinstall -t -r"
 - Wait for the compilation to finish. 
 - If you encounter a problem with the installation, refer to the SHERPA
   mini documentation which is available from the Sherpa homepage
   www.sherpa-mc.de. If this does not help contact the authors at 
   support@sherpa-mc.de and attach the installation log 
   "sherpa_install.log" to your mail.
